<h2> Week 0 </h2>

Introduction to CS50AI. Projects: tic-tact-oe AI game and "degrees" project.

<h2> Tic-tac-toe: </h2>

A simple game where you play against an AI. Play as either X, the maximizing player who moves first, or the minimizing player O.

<h3> Installation </h3>

install the required Python package (pygame) for this project.
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

<h2> Degrees </h2>

Write a program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are.

For example, Emma Watson and Jennifer Lawrence, one inputted, will output - 

3 degrees of separation.
1: Emma Watson and Brendan Gleeson starred in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
2: Brendan Gleeson and Michael Fassbender starred in Trespass Against Us
3: Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence starred in X-Men: First Clas

<h3> Installation </h3>

None.

<h2> Week 1 </h2>

<h2> Knights </h2>

A logic game. Try this yourself and see how long it will take you to reason through the puzzles. Using knowledge and propositional logic, the AI will be able to reason through all of them to consider whether each character is either a knight or a knave.

Puzzle 0 is the puzzle from the Background. It contains a single character, A.
A says “I am both a knight and a knave.”

Puzzle 1 has two characters: A and B.
A says “We are both knaves.”
B says nothing.

Puzzle 2 has two characters: A and B.
A says “We are the same kind.”
B says “We are of different kinds.”

Puzzle 3 has three characters: A, B, and C.
A says either “I am a knight.” or “I am a knave.”, but you don’t know which.
B says “A said ‘I am a knave.’”
B then says “C is a knave.”
C says “A is a knight.”

In each of the above puzzles, each character is either a knight or a knave. Every sentence spoken by a knight is true, and every sentence spoken by a knave is false.

<h3> Installation </h3>

None.
