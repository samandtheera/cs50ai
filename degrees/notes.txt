To implement the def shortest_path(source, target) function, this is what I want to do:

1. Make source my start state - a name of an actor.
2. Add source to the frontier
3. Remove first node from frontier
4. Run neighbours_for_person func. to accept a person's id as input and return a set of (movie_id, person_id)
   pairs for all people who starred in a movie with a given person.
5. Check this neighbours list to check for our goal (target)
6. If this is our target, return the node.
